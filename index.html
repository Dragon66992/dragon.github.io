                        <p>Phnom Sampeau is an archaeological site located in Sampeau Commune, about 12 km of Battambang city. This attraction is steeped in history and legend. It is home to the infamous Killing Caves and a Bat Cave. Also, atop a 100-meter-high mountain stands a pagoda. It is also home to three natural caves - Pkasla, Lakhaon and Aksopheak.</p>
                        <p>Apart from the cave, there is a beautiful viewpoint from where you can see the green fields in the Battambang region. At dusk, hundreds of thousands of bats fly out of the cave, forming a spectacle which is viewed by hundreds of tourists who gather. Phnom Sampeau makes for an exciting day trip from Battambang for the natural Bat phenomenon, lovely countryside views and a dark history of Cambodia that occurred during the Khmer Rouge.</p>
                        <p>Phnom Sampeau in local language translates to 'Ship mountain,' named due to its shape resembling a ship. During the Khmer Rouge rule between 1975 and 1979, approximately 3 millions of innocent were massacred by torture and thrown to death through the skylight above. Remnants of war, including a part of an aircraft wing present below, is oriented towards Phnom Krapau or The Crocodile Mountain, which was the strategic location of the Khmer Rouge during the war. Later, the pagoda at the top also served as a prison and torture centre during the Pol Pot-led era. Today, you can find many temple complexes and several viewpoints at the summit, famous for the sunset.</p>

                    <p>The Killing Caves of Phnom Sampeau, located halfway up the hill is now a place of pilgrimage. This cave consists of a giant statue of reclining golden Buddha at the centre. There is a memorial of human remains - hundreds of bones and skulls encased in a glass box, a haunting reminder of the dark past. Nearby, there is another memorial - a rusty cage made of chicken wire and cyclone fencing. The descent from this cave offers beautiful views of the greenery, including dramatic cliff edges, vines and views of the nearby hills in the horizon.</p>
                    <p>At the base of the hill,  there is a 15-meter high statue of Buddha carved out of a cliff, which remains incomplete due to the lack of funds. On the way up to the top, you'll come across big groups of macaques that feed on the nearby plantations. Avoid offering food or seeking their attention as they can get aggressive.</p>
                    <p>Beside Phnom Sampeau, there are several other groups of mountains including Phnom Krapeu, Phnom Trung Moan and Phnom Neang Romsay Sok, the mountain is famous for its legend on Romsay Sok.</p>
                    <p><b>Ticket details</b> : The entry ticket costs 2 USD which gives access to three sites of Wat Ek Phnom, Phnom Sampeau and Phnom Banan. Tickets are sold in all these sites.</p>

                    <div>
                        <p>Wat Ek Phnom is an impressive Angkorian temple in the town of Battambang in northwestern Cambodia. The temple is a very famous picnic and pilgrimage destination for local Khmers at festival times. Mostly in ruins, visitors have to walk through large blocks of stone in the temple premises, which feels like traveling back in time, making it a popular attraction in Battambang. Visit this temple ruin for its well-carved pediments and lintels.</p>
                        <p>Wat Ek Phnom was built during the Bayon period in the 11th century under the reign of King Suryavarman I. It was initially a Hindu temple, and later on, was turned into a Buddhist shrine after succeeding Buddhist kings undertook the construction of Buddhism related sculptures.</p>
                        <p>Wat Ek Phnom is built of sandstone blocks. The sanatorium is surrounded by a laterite outer wall and a Baray, which consists of Prasats or small shrines. These shrines stand on a large square stone platform. Most of these sculptures in the temple premises are in ruins, with the only remaining structure being the main towers of the temple. There is a lintel depicting the churning of the Ocean of Milk above the eastern entrance. The upper flanks of the central tower contain some intricately carved bas-reliefs.</p>
                        <p>Next to the temple area is Sangkae pond beside which is a colourful modern pagoda. The pagoda contains a giant 28 meters high Buddha statue, which is surrounded by 18 Bodhi trees, also called as Peacock trees in Khmer.</p>
                        <p>As with the other temples in Cambodia, it is expected that tourists dress appropriately. Women need to cover their shoulder at all times and wear knee-length attire. Sleeveless shirts and shorts aren't also allowed for both men and women.</p>
